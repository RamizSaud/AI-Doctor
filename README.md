# AI Doctor for Patient Diagnosis & Treatment Consultation

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-driven healthcare assistant by training a LLaMA 3 model on medically researched patient-doctor conversations. The model achieves **85% BERTScore accuracy**, enabling it to provide:

- **AI-driven diagnosis** based on patient symptoms.
- **Medication recommendations** tailored to individual cases.
- **Specialist referrals** when required for further medical consultation.

Additionally, a **web-based application** was developed to make the AI accessible to users. The application was **deployed on AWS**, ensuring scalability and availability for real-world usage.
