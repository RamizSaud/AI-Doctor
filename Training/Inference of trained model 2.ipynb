But some antibiotics can interact with painkillers and can increase the risk of bleeding. So better to avoid painkillers when you are on antibiotics. If you are on painkillers, then you can take antibiotics. But avoid painkillers. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.\n"
