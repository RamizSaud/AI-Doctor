If you have seasonal allergies, you should take an antihistamine. It is the first line of treatment. You can take a combination of antihistamine and steroid nasal spray. If you are not responding to treatment, you should consult an allergist. He will perform skin tests and prescribe you an antiallergic medication. Hope to have been helpful! Kind regards, \n"
