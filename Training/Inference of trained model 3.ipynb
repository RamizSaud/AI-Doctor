      "Hello! Welcome to Chat Doctor. Allergic rhinitis is a common condition. It is also known as hay fever. It is caused by allergens such as pollen, mold spores, dust mites, animal dander and insect venom. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, itching of nose and eyes, and nasal congestion. In severe cases, the symptoms may be accompanied by headaches, sore throat, cough, wheezing, and ear pain. The symptoms usually occur during the season when the allergen is most common. The symptoms may be relieved by antihistamines, decongestants, or nasal corticosteroids. In severe cases, immunotherapy may be required. It is important to note that allergic rhinitis is not contagious. Hope this helps. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor.\n"

      "Hello, I read carefully your question and understand your concern. I would explain that it is not recommended to take antibiotics along with painkillers. The reason is that painkillers can affect the absorption of antibiotics. The best way is to take the antibiotics at least 1 hour before taking the painkillers. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me. Best wishes, \n"
